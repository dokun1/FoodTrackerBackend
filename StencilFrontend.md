Now that there is a FoodServer backend for the [FoodTracker](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend) app, you can add a website front end so that the page displayed by your server is more visually appealing than returning a JSON array of meals. The steps below demonstrate how to add a Stencil template to your server so that it can return dynamic web pages, using [Kitura-TemplateEngine](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-TemplateEngine) and [Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine).


## Pre-Requisites:
These instructions follow on from the FoodTracker application and server created by following the [FoodTrackerBackend](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend) tutorial. If you have completed the FoodTracker Backend there are no further pre-requisites.

If you have not completed the [FoodTrackerBackend](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend) tutorial go to the [CompletedFoodTracker](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend/tree/CompletedFoodTracker) branch and follow the [README](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend/blob/CompletedFoodTracker/README.md) instructions.

## Using A Stencil Template
The FoodTracker application is taken from the Apple tutorial for building your first iOS application. In the [FoodTrackerBackend](https://github.com/IBM/FoodTrackerBackend) tutorial, we created a server and connected it to the iOS application. This means that when meals are added they are posted to the server, a user can then view these meals on [localhost:8080/meals](http://localhost:8080/meals). When you perform a HTTP `GET` request to the server, you are returned a JSON array which contains your stored meals. To present this data in a more appealing way we will use [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil). Stencil is a template language for Swift which allows you to embed code into a HTML document to create a dynamic web page.

### Create the Stencil File
To use templates with a Kitura router, you must create a `.stencil` template file which describes how to embed code into the returned HTML. By default, the Kitura router gets the template files from the `./Views/` directory in the directory where Kitura runs.

1. In the terminal, change into the FoodServer directory:
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer
```
2. Create the Views folder and change into it:
```
mkdir Views
cd Views
```
3. Create a `FoodTemplate.stencil` file, then open it with any text editor:
```
touch FoodTemplate.stencil
open -a Xcode.app FoodTemplate.stencil
```

**NB**: You can use any text editor to open the `.stencil` file.

4. Add the following Stencil template code to display the meals:

```
<html>
There are {{ meals.count }} meals. <br />
{% for meal in meals %}
    - {{ meal.name }} with rating {{ meal.rating }} <br />
{% endfor %}
</html>
```
5. Save the file and exit your text editor.

When the above code is rendered, it will display the total number of meals in your meal store, it will then loop through the meal store displaying each meal name and rating. For more details about Stencil templates see the [Stencil User Guide](http://stencil.fuller.li/en/latest/).


### Add the Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine dependency
[Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine), allows users to easily use Stencil templates in Swift and needs to be added to our `Package.swift` file.

1. In the terminal, go to your server's `Package.swift` file.
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer
open Package.swift
```
2. Add the `Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine` package:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine.git", from: "1.8.0")
```
3. Change the target for Application to include "KituraStencil":
```swift
.target(name: "Application", dependencies: [ "Kitura", "CloudEnvironment", "SwiftMetrics", "Health", "SwiftKueryORM", "SwiftKueryPostgreSQL", "KituraStencil"]),
```
4. Regenerate your FoodServer Xcode project:
```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

### Add the Stencil template engine
1. Open your `Sources > Application > Application.swift` file
2. Add KituraStencil to the import statements:
```swift
import KituraStencil
```
3. Add the template engine to the router.

Inside the `postInit()` function, insert the following line, below `router.get("/meals", handler: loadHandler)`:
```swift
router.add(templateEngine: StencilTemplateEngine())
```

The router will now use a `StencilTemplateEngine()` to render `.stencil` templates.

### Adding a route for the template
Here we define a new route for our server which we will use to return the formatted HTML. This is done using Kitura 1 style (i.e. not Codable) routing with `request`, `response` and `next` parameters. We will render the `.stencil` file and add this to the `response`.

1. Add a new route for `GET` on "/foodtracker".
Add the following code on the line below `router.add(templateEngine: StencilTemplateEngine())`:
```swift
router.get("/foodtracker") { request, response, next in
    next()
}
```
2. Build a JSON string description of the FoodTracker meal store.
Add the following code inside your â€œ/foodtracker" route above `next()`:

```swift
Meal.findAll { (result: [Meal]?, error: RequestError?) in
    guard let meals = result else {
        return
    }
    var allMeals: [String: [[String:Any]]] = ["meals" :[]]
    for meal in meals {
        allMeals["meals"]?.append(["name": meal.name, "rating": meal.rating])
    }
}
```
3. Render the template and add it to your `response`.
Add the following line above `next()`:
```swift
do {
    try response.render("FoodTemplate.stencil", context: allMeals)
} catch let error {
    response.send(json: ["Error": error.localizedDescription])
}
```
This will render the `FoodTemplate.stencil` file using `allMeals` to embed variables from the code.

4. Your completed "/foodtracker" route should now look as follows:

```swift
router.get("/foodtracker") { request, response, next in
    Meal.findAll { (result: [Meal]?, error: RequestError?) in
        guard let meals = result else {
            return
        }
        var allMeals: [String: [[String:Any]]] = ["meals" :[]]
        for meal in meals {
            allMeals["meals"]?.append(["name": meal.name, "rating": meal.rating])
        }
        do {
            try response.render("FoodTemplate.stencil", context: allMeals)
        } catch let error {
            response.send(json: ["Error": error.localizedDescription])
        }
        next()
    }
}
```
We can test this route by running the FoodTracker application and the FoodServer. Add a meal in the app and then go to [http://localhost:8080/foodtracker](http://localhost:8080/foodtracker). This will now display a line saying how many meals are present in the app and a list of the meal names and ratings.

## Displaying a Photo using a Static File Server
Our meal tracker application allows users to upload a photograph of their meal. We would like to add this photograph to our web page as a picture and not as a string of data as it is currently displayed. To achieve this we will save the user photos and then implement a Static File Server which will serve the photos using our Stencil template.

### Saving photos on the server
1. In the terminal, create the "public" directory:
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer
mkdir public
```
The default location for a static file server to serve files from is the ./public directory so we will create this directory on our server to save our users' pictures in.

2. Open your `Sources > Application > Application.swift` file.
3. Set up the file handler to write to the web hosting directory by adding the following under the `cloudEnv` declaration:
```swift
private var fileManager = FileManager.default
private var rootPath = StaticFileServer().absoluteRootPath
```
4. Save the pictures received by the server.
Add the following code to the beginning of your `storeHandler`:
```swift
let path = "\(self.rootPath)/\(meal.name).jpg"
fileManager.createFile(atPath: path, contents: meal.photo)
```
This will create a file with the name of your meal and a .jpg extension inside the public directory of your server. If the file already exists it will overwrite it with a new picture. You can test this by re-running the FoodServer with your changes and adding a meal - the photo should appear in the "public" directory you just created.

5. Your `storeHandler` function should now look as follows:
```swift
func storeHandler(meal: Meal, completion: (Meal?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    let path = "\(self.rootPath)/\(meal.name).jpg"
    fileManager.createFile(atPath: path, contents: meal.photo)
    meal.save(completion)
}
```

### Adding the photos to the Stencil template

1. Add a static file server route for images.

Insert the following line below `router.get("/meals", handler: loadHandler)`:
```swift
router.get("/images", middleware: StaticFileServer())
```
2. Open your "FoodTemplate.stencil" file:
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer/Views
open -a Xcode.app FoodTemplate.stencil
```
3. Add the following line in your `for` loop below the line  `- {{ meal.name }} with rating {{ meal.rating }}. <br />`
```
<img src="images/{{ meal.name }}.jpg" alt="meal image" height="100"> <br />
```
This will make a call to the server for the image saved with the meal and display it.

Restart your server to add your new changes. Then add a new meal and view your front end meal store at [http://localhost:8080/foodtracker](http://localhost:8080/foodtracker). You should see a webpage displaying the total number of meals and a list of the meal names, rating and as well as a picture of the meal.
Congratulations! You have now taken a meal from the app, set up a Kitura server to receive the data and displayed it embedded in HTML to a web page.

## Submitting a Meal from the Webpage
The user wants to be able to submit meals from the web page as well as the app. We will use a HTML form to post data to the Kitura server. We will parse the received data using the Kitura `BodyParser`, add a meal to our meal store and display the new meal.

### Adding a Form to the Webpage

1. In the terminal, change into the `Views` directory:
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer/Views
```
2. Open your `FoodTemplate.stencil` file:
```
open -a Xcode.app FoodTemplate.stencil
```
3. Add the following code below `{% endfor %}`:
```
<form action="foodtracker" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
    Rating: <input type="range" name="rating" min="0" max="5"><br>
    File: <input type="file" name="photo"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
4. Refresh your [http://localhost:8080/foodtracker](http://localhost:8080/foodtracker) to view the form.

This code creates a multipart form with three fields. A name text box, a rating slider and a `Browse` button to select files. When you click submit, it will `POST` a multipart form to "/foodtracker" with the data from the form.


### Using BodyParser on the POST route of "/foodtracker"

1. Open the FoodServer  `Sources > Application > Application.swift` file.
2. Connect the `BodyParser` middleware.

Inside the `postInit()` function, add `BodyParser` to your route:
```swift
router.post("/foodtracker", middleware: BodyParser())
```
3. Add a Kitura 1 style `POST` route for "/foodtracker".

Add the following code beneath your `BodyParser` route:
```swift
router.post("/foodtracker") { request, response, next in
    next()
}
```
4. Parse the `request` body with `BodyParser`.

Add the following code inside your â€œ/foodtracker" post route above `next()`:
```swift
guard let parsedBody = request.body else {
    next()
    return
}
```
5. Split the `parsedBody` into a MultiPart array.

Add the following line after the `guard` statement:
```swift
let parts = parsedBody.asMultiPart
```

### Save the MultiPart array as a meal object

1. Parse the MultiPart array as a meal object.

Insert the following code beneath your `parts` declaration:
```swift
guard let name = parts?[0].body.asText,
    let stringRating = parts?[1].body.asText,
    let rating = Int(stringRating),
    case .raw(let photo)? = parts?[2].body,
    parts?[2].type == "image/jpeg",
    let newMeal = Meal(name: name, photo: photo, rating: rating)
else {
    next()
    return
}
```
2. Save the meal and the photo.

Insert the following code after the else block:
```swift
let path = "\(self.rootPath)/\(newMeal.name).jpg"
self.fileManager.createFile(atPath: path, contents: newMeal.photo)
newMeal.save { (meal: Meal?, error: RequestError?) in
    next()
}
```
For simplicity we are only accepting `.jpg` files from the web page.

3. Redirect the user to the `GET` "/foodtracker" route.

Add the following line below the route declaration:
```swift
try response.redirect("/foodtracker")
```
This will reload the page and prevent meals being submitted multiple times.

4. Your completed "/foodtracker" `POST` route should now look as follows:
```swift
router.post("/foodtracker") { request, response, next in
    try response.redirect("/foodtracker")
    guard let parsedBody = request.body else {
        next()
        return
    }
    let parts = parsedBody.asMultiPart
    guard let name = parts?[0].body.asText,
        let stringRating = parts?[1].body.asText,
        let rating = Int(stringRating),
        case .raw(let photo)? = parts?[2].body,
        parts?[2].type == "image/jpeg",
        let newMeal = Meal(name: name, photo: photo, rating: rating)
    else {
        next()
        return
    }
	 let path = "\(self.rootPath)/\(newMeal.name).jpg"
	 self.fileManager.createFile(atPath: path, contents: newMeal.photo)
	 newMeal.save { (meal: Meal?, error: RequestError?) in
	     next()
	 }
}
```

Restart your server to add your new changes. When you add a new meal at [http://localhost:8080/foodtracker](http://localhost:8080/foodtracker), you should see the webpage update with your new meal.

## Adding HTML and CSS

We have provided some basic html and css in a file called `Example.stencil`. To improve the presentation of the webpage, we will serve this template instead of `FoodTemplate.stencil`.

### Move `Example.Stencil` to the Views folder
1. Open your terminal window.
2. Change directory to your FoodTrackerBackend
```
cd ~/FoodTrackerBackend/
```
3. Move `Example.Stencil` to your Views folder.
```
mv Example.stencil FoodServer/Views/
```

### Change the target of `response.render` to display `Example.Stencil`

1. Open your `Sources > Application > Application.swift` file.

2. Replace `FoodTemplate.stencil` with `Example.stencil` in the `response.render` call:
```swift
try response.render("Example.stencil", context: allMeals)
```
3. Restart the server to compile the new route.

Now view your webpage at [http://localhost:8080/foodtracker](http://localhost:8080/foodtracker). Your front end will have CSS styling to create a complete food tracker website!
